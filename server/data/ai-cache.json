    "summary": "The IoT network appears generally healthy with strong signal strength and healthy battery levels across all modules. However, there are several areas of concern and opportunities for improvement. All modules are of an 'undefined' type, suggesting a lack of proper configuration or identification. Despite seemingly good sensor data volume, only one module is actively sending data. There is an increasing trend of emergencies, with 'undefined' modules being the most frequent contributors. Logs and sensor data are absent for the last hour, which is concerning, but the overall log health status is reported as healthy.",
    "recommendations": [
      "Investigate why all modules are classified as 'undefined' and properly configure/identify them.",
      "Determine why only one module is actively sending sensor data and troubleshoot the other modules.",
      "Analyze the nature and cause of the increasing emergency trend, focusing on 'undefined' modules.",
      "Investigate the reason for the absence of sensor data and logs within the last hour and ensure continuous monitoring.",
      "Implement a system for classifying and prioritizing emergencies based on severity, beyond just 'undefined'."
    ],
    "criticalIssues": [
      "Only one module actively sending sensor data despite having four modules in total, indicating a significant data collection bottleneck.",
      "Increasing trend of emergencies, potentially indicating a developing system-wide problem.",
      "All modules registered as 'undefined' which hints at a fundamental configuration or identification problem.",
      "Lack of sensor data and log entries in the last hour raises concerns about data availability and potential system downtime."
    ],
    "opportunities": [
      "Improve module identification and configuration to provide more granular insights into network performance.",
      "Implement proactive monitoring and alerting based on sensor data to prevent future emergencies.",
      "Optimize data collection and transmission to ensure all modules contribute to the overall network intelligence.",
      "Develop a robust logging system to capture and analyze events for faster troubleshooting and improved security."
