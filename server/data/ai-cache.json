  "lastInsights": {
    "summary": "The IoT network shows a mixed state. While the modules have good battery health and strong signal, they are mostly undefined in type and status. Sensor data is consistent, but a significant number of emergencies are occurring, with a concerning upward trend and undefined module source. Logs are currently clean, but the undefined nature of several components warrants immediate attention.",
    "recommendations": [
      "Investigate and define the 'undefined' module types to properly categorize and manage devices.",
      "Address the 'undefined' emergency severity and module origin to understand the nature of the emergencies and implement appropriate mitigation strategies. Prioritize identifying the specific device(s) or environmental factors causing these emergencies.",
      "Monitor the emergency trend closely, as the increasing rate suggests a potential systemic issue.",
      "Investigate why only one module is reported as active for the sensors."
    ],
    "criticalIssues": [
      "High number of emergencies (68 total, 14 in the last hour) with an increasing trend.",
      "Undefined module types and emergency severity hinders effective troubleshooting and response.",
      "Only one module is reported as active for the sensors while the total number of modules is 4."
    ],
    "opportunities": [
      "Leverage the strong signal and healthy battery status of modules to deploy more advanced features and data collection.",
      "Analyze the sensor data to identify patterns and predict potential issues before they escalate into emergencies.",
      "Implement automated alerts and response mechanisms for identified emergency scenarios."
