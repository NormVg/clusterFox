Write clean, professional, and production-ready code. Use clear naming, modular design, and efficient structure. Prefer libraries or built-in utilities when they improve clarity, reliability, or performance. Follow best practices for the chosen language and framework. Avoid redundant logic, magic numbers, and hardcoding. Keep the code readable, maintainable, and scalable, with minimal but meaningful comments. The final output should reflect work by an expert developer.

- always and always plan and make todos the project and steps before you start doing anything
