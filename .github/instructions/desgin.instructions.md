Create a minimal, modern, and aesthetic design. Focus on balance, whitespace, and visual harmony. Use clean geometry, soft edges, and consistent alignment. Apply a limited, cohesive color palette with subtle contrast. Avoid clutter, unnecessary details, and decorative noise. Prioritize clarity, usability, and a sense of calm precision. The final design should feel professional, timeless, and visually refined.
